Why is PTSD not included as a full assessment area in the Conners CBRS?	"One of the main reasons for not including PTSD is that the wording of the items would have been problematic for a rating scale. A diagnosis of PTSD requires that the individual has been exposed to a traumatic event (this is our clinical indicator item). All the subsequent criteria are directly linked into this traumatic event. Therefore, in order to be sure that we are assessing PTSD, each one of the PTSD items had to be worded so that the symptom was linked to the traumatic event (e.g., Gets upset when he/she sees or hears things that remind him/her of a traumatic event that has happened; Has flashbacks of a tragic event that has happened; acts or feels like it is happening again). We received a lot of feedback from individuals completing the pilot versions of the forms who indicated that these items were problematic because they presume that the person completing the form has experienced a traumatic event. A lot of discussion went into wording the items more generally, but then we would have lost the relevance to PTSD, and could not be sure that the symptoms are due to a traumatic event."	Clin-Ed
How long should someone wait in between CDI 2 administrations for progress monitoring.	It is recommended to wait at least 2 weeks in between administrations as the timeframe in the instructions is to describe the child during the past 2 weeks.  You don't want to overlap the timeframe in the instructions.	Clin-Ed
How long should someone wait in between MASC 2 administrations for progress monitoring.	"For the MASC 2 it’s a bit trickier as the form uses the reference points of “recently” or “in the last while”. These timeframes were purposely left open for interpretation to ensure that no specific time was referenced when responding to the items that could inadvertently exclude relevant information about the child’s behavior. Having said this, in one of the case studies in the manual progress monitoring took place 4-weeks after the pre-treatment baseline evaluation suggesting that “recently” and “in the last while” at least falls within the 4 week timeframe.  Given that the DSM anxiety related disorders have various timeframes for which the behaviors must be present, keeping the timeframe open allowed the scores to be applicable across different criterion sets in DSM."

When was the standardization sample collected for the Conners 3?	The data was collected between March 2006 and August 2007.	Clin-Ed
Why are norms important for the EQ360?	"There are really multiple reasons for the importance of norms in the context of the 360 assessment. First of all, the normal rationale for norms and standard scores apply to 360 just as they would to any other type of assessment. Raw scores on their own do not provide a direct and meaningful way to report the data, while standard scores (derived using norms) allows you to immediately contrast scores to the normative mean (or average benchmark from the population). We set the average standard score at 100 and score ranges above and below that mark have easy interpretations based on how far above or below the mean a score falls. For the EQ-360, rater standard scores have the same basic utility. They allow a user to contrast the responses and scores of a rater directly to benchmarks or norms obtained from other raters. For example, a Total EI score of 110 from managers suggests that the individual being rated scores higher than ratings typically given by raters including managers. The norm group acts as a meaningful comparison point to facilitate interpretation of responses. Now it is possible that we could have used different norms for each of the rater groups. However, when we analyzed our large pool of data during the development of this assessment, we found no differences based on rater type that were large enough to justify different norms for each rater group. So, all of these groups are based on the same norms. These results are described in the documentation and make for useful reading for those interested in this area. The pertinent section is under “Norming Procedures,” and the statistical analyses are summarized in Tables A.43 through A.47.  "	TA
"for  the EQ-i, is Flexibility considered a ""core"" factor for emotional intelligence?"	"Flexibility is a 'core' component of emotional and social intelligence and not a 'facilitating factor' of this construct. Within the conceptual framework, this is the ability to adapt and adjust one's emotions, thinking and behaviour to new, different and changing situations and conditions. This is, essentially, the ability to handle change, which is a very important characteristic of emotionally and socially competent people. The ability to be flexible and adaptable, within this context, is another way of having our emotions work for us rather than against us (of being in control of emotions rather than being controlled by them), which is a very important aspect of emotional intelligence. "	TA
Can you clarify where I can find informaiton on the norm samples used in the LS/CMI?	Appendix D are percentiles for adult only samples (must have reported age to be 18+). (Young offender samples are provided in Appendix C). Appendix F describes the overall sample (including all cases in addition to cases where age was not specified).	Public Safety
Can I get information on the score ranges used in the M-PULSE?	"The manual has interpretation information, but it may not have all that he has requested. Table 5.25 has guidelines for interpreting scale scores (empirical scales, post scales). For the validity scales, T-scores above 70 are considered ""probably invalid,"" and T-scores from 60-69 ""possibly invalid."" For the liability scales, the cut-offs are actually based on the raw scores with scores >= +1.5 being ""At risk,"" scores between +0.5 and +1.5 being ""some concern,"" scores between -1.0 and +0.5 being ""average,"" and scores less than -1 being ""low risk."""
